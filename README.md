# GwionSamples

This repo is intended as a place to share useful Gwion examples.


## Adding code

  * First create a `.gw` file in the `code` directory

  * Create an `.mdr` file in the `docs` directory

  * Add your file (with an md suffix) to `docs/list`

You can see an example of what an mdr file should look like at `docs/risset_beats.mdr`.
